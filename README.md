# ChatBot

This is a simple chatbot project implemented in Python.

## Features

- Basic chatbot logic
- Batch processing (based on the `Batches.py` file)
- Designed for learning and experimentation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ChatBot.git
   cd ChatBot
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if you have a `requirements.txt`):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python Batches.py
```

Modify or extend the chatbot logic inside `Batches.py` according to your needs.

## Notes

- Make sure not to upload the `.venv` folder to GitHub. Itâ€™s better to add a `.gitignore` file with the following line:
  ```
  .venv/
  ```
